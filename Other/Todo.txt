- Features:
    - user lists on their profiles
    - QSlide for LG
    - gallery of picture on searching
    - tweetmarker in lists
    - rotation on tweet viewer
    - Night mode for themes
    - easier manipulation of lists on users profiles (view all the lists they are apart of and add/remove them from them)
    - better intent filter for the search so it doesn't get everything
    - 1x1 widget for unread count on timeline
    - seconds instead of 0m on timeline
    - Pictures on the right for your send direct messages

- Bugs:
    - browser doesn't always close when backing out of it (maybe add to a count or something to keep track of how many pages have been added)
    - switch mentions to save the position instead of current unread method
    - rotating device will sometimes jump to the top of timeline (better rotation on timeline!)
    - direct messages get lost if you receive one before sending and after pulling to refresh
    - html spacing on the tweet viewer


-- Staged for Release (Roadmap) --

NOTE: These are by no means final. I work on things when I get the time and in the order that I feel is most important...
If something new comes along that I want to work on instead, then I will do that :)
Some of these things have been on here for quite awhile and I just haven't gotten to them because I keep finding new things that
I think are more important for the development of the app.

Please keep that in mind when viewing this roadmap. It is simply a rough estimate, and I will not be providing any timetable for it
either, or ETA's, so please do not ask for them

    Version 3.4 (finally make more extra pages)
        - allow the user to set up to 3 or 4... undecided on this as of now.
        - More fragments to choose from
            - search fragment (with search box and saved search) on main timelines
            - second account mentions page on timeline
            - second account timeline page
            - favorite tweets fragment
            - Activity fragment


    Version 3.5 (some random stuff that I want to do)
        - conversation indicator on tweets
        - instagram video support
        - mute users for a time period
        - swipe through multiple pictures on the image viewer
        - bug with unfollowing public lists
        - "muffle" tweets instead of simply muting them
            - Hide them, waiting for expansion


    Version 3.6 (Widget updates)
        - expand the widget for mentions and multiple account support
        - 1x1 "tweeting" widget just to compose a tweet
        - timestamp on widget
